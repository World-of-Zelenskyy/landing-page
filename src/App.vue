      World of Zelensky was built with the goal to support the country of
      Ukraine during these hard times.
      <br />
      While the brave people fight to protect their land, we must step up and
      help however we can.
      <br />
      WoZ pfpâ€™s are meant to empower the symbol of their courageous president
      and support the people of Ukraine by directly linking the sales to their
      cause.
      <br /><br />
      100% of all sales and profits from the collection and secondary market
      will be sent directly to the official Ukrainian ETH wallet:
